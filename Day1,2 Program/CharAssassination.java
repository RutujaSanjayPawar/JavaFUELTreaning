/*Exercise 3
The following program uses primitive data type char: */

public class CharAssassination
{
 public static void main ( String[] args )
 {
 char ch = "A" ;
 System.out.println("A char: " + ch );
 }
}



/* The variable ch is 16 bits of main memory that uses the char data type to represent characters. 
The a bit pattern that represents 'A' is placed in it. The program writes: 
A char: A

Do the following: 
• Change the 'A' into 'Z' and compile and run.
• Change the 'A' into 'AA' and try to compile the program.
• Change the 'A' into ' ' and compile and run the program. 
o Notice carefully: there is a single space between the two ' marks.
• Change the 'A' into '' and try to compile. 
o Notice carefully: there is no character between the two ' marks.
• Change the 'A' into "A" and try to compile the program. 
o (The double quotes " signify a String, which is something different from a char).

Observe and explain what works and what does not work in the above. */
